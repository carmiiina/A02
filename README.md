1. Installing Git <a name="installing-git"></a>

Download and install Git from the official website: Git Downloads
2. Setting up Git <a name="setting-up-git"></a>

Open a terminal or command prompt and set your username and email:

bash

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

3. Creating a Local Repository <a name="creating-a-local-repository"></a>

    Create a new directory for your project: mkdir my_project
    Navigate into the directory: cd my_project
    Initialize a Git repository: git init

4. Making Changes <a name="making-changes"></a>

    Create or modify files in your project.
    Use git status to see which files have been modified.

5. Committing Changes <a name="committing-changes"></a>

    Add files to the staging area: git add filename or git add . to add all files.
    Commit changes: git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"

6. Creating a GitHub Repository <a name="creating-a-github-repository"></a>

    Go to GitHub and log in (or sign up).
    Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
    Fill in the details, optionally add a .gitignore and license.
    Click "Create repository".

7. Pushing to GitHub <a name="pushing-to-github"></a>

    Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
    Add the remote repository: git remote add origin <repository_url>
    Push your local repository to GitHub: git push -u origin master

8. Pulling Changes <a name="pulling-changes"></a>

If someone else makes changes:

    Fetch changes from the remote repository: git fetch origin
    Merge the changes into your local branch: git merge origin/master

9. Branching and Merging <a name="branching-and-merging"></a>

    Create a new branch: git branch new_branch
    Switch to the new branch: git checkout new_branch
    Make changes, commit, and push as before.
    Merge branches: git checkout master then git merge new_branch

10. Collaborating with Others <a name="collaborating-with-others"></a>

    Add collaborators on GitHub in the repository settings.
    Collaborators clone the repository, make changes, commit, and push.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

You now have a basic understanding of how to use Git and GitHub for version control. Keep practicing, and explore more advanced features as you become comfortable with the basics. Happy coding!


You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.
This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.

PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.
